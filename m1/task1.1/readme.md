# My results of work in git.

First of all I've created a structure of directory of my repo and committed it.
Next actions:
1. I created a new branch "develop". At this branch the file index.html was created.
2. At the next step I created a new branch "images". And into the frame of this branch I created new directory and fill it some images. Also I created another file "index.html".
3. At the third step I've created a new branch from branch "develop" for adding new directory "styles".
4. After all I tried to compose all branches to main branch. As result **I got a conflict**. I should resolve this conflict for proper unification all branches.
5. At the last step I've pushed all files to online repository.
