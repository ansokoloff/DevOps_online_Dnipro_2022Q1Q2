- This command show:
  - user login
  - the current time
  - how long the system has been running
  - how many users are currently logged on, and the system load aver‚Äê
    ages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
- for each user: 
  - login name 
  - the tty name 
  - the remote host 
  - login time 
  - idle time 
  - JCPU 
  - PCPU 
  - the command line of their current process.

         The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the tty.  It does not include past background jobs, but  does
         include currently running background jobs.

         The PCPU time is the time used by the current process, named in the "what" field
